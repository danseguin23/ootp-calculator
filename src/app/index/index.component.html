    <h2>POSITION CALCULATOR</h2>
    <p>I created this site because I always found myself wondering how good my OOTP players could be if I changed their position. Thanks to a little experimentation, I was able to figure out the formulas to calculate players' maximum possible position ratings based on their current defensive ratings.</p>
    <p>Right now, you can use the <a routerLink="/position-calculator">position calculator</a> to determine exactly how good your players could be at any position.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>PROJECTIONS</h2>
    <p>Projections are finally here! The projection calculator is able to project full-season stats based on a batter or pitcher's current ratings. I have a lot of ideas for improving the projections, so keep an eye out for subtle (or not so subtle) changes.</p>
    <p>Find the batter projection calculator <a routerLink="/batter-projections">here</a>, or the pitcher projection calculator <a routerLink="/pitcher-projections">here</a>.</p>
