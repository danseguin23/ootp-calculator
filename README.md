# OOTP Calculator

Welcome! This is version 2.something of the OOTP Calculator. You can find older versions under different branches if that's what you're looking for.

## Setup

If you want to run this locally, clone the repo, call `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm run serve` to run.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute to the calculator, go nuts. Good luck sifting through my spaghetti code!
