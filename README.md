# OOTP Calculator (Vue)

Welcome! This is version 2.0 of the OOTP Calculator which was written using Vue.js. Why did I scrap the perfectly good Angular version, you might ask? Why did I commit the [cardinal sin of software development](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)? Great question. I guess I thought it was gonna be fun? Anyways, this version has a few more features than the last so it might have been worth it.

If you were looking for the repo for the original OOTP Calculator, find it [here](https://github.com/danseguin23/ootp-calculator).

## Setup

If you want to run this locally, clone the repo, call `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm run serve` to run.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute to the calculator, go nuts. Good luck sifting through my spaghetti code!
