# OOTP Calculator

The OOTP Calculator is a utility application used to assist in desicions while playing [OOTP Baseball](https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/out-of-the-park-baseball-home/). If you don't know what OOTP is, you probably won't find this repo very helpful.

This is version 2.1.something of the OOTP Calculator, and the online application can be found at [ootpcalculator.com](https://ootpcalculator.com/). Older versions of the calculator can be found under different branches if that's what you're looking for.

## Tools

Currently, the site supports the following functionality:

- **Position Calculator**: Enter fielding ratings for a player to generate position ratings,
- **Batter Projections**: Enter batting ratings for a player(s) to calculate estimated full-season batting stats,
- **Pitcher Projections**: Same as batter projections, but for pitchers.

## Setup

If you want to run this locally, clone the repo, call `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm run serve` to run.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute to the calculator, be my guest. Fair warning though - I didn't originally intend this project to be open-source, so the code may be difficult to sift through.
