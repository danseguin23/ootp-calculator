# OOTP Calculator

This version of the calculator is deprecated, but I figured I'd keep it up since this version is a little easier to run on your own computer. Keep in mind the formulas are slightly off, so the results from this calculator may be a little different than the current version.

You can find the source code for the current version [here](https://github.com/danseguin23/ootp-calculator/tree/master), or the live app [here](https://ootpcalculator.com).
