                <h2 class="title">POSITION CALCULATOR</h2>
                <p>I created this site because I always found myself wondering how good my OOTP players could be if I changed their position. Thanks to a little experimentation, I was able to figure out the formulas to calculate players' maximum possible position ratings based on their current defensive ratings.</p>
                <p>Right now, you can use the <a href="position-calculator.html">position calculator</a> to determine exactly how good your players could be at any position.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="title">PROJECTIONS</h2>
                <p>Some time in the (hopefully) near future, I'll have a functioning calculator to determine a player's projected stats based on their ratings. It's not quite ready yet, though, so hang tight!</p>
                <br>
